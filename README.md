# Mayhem Game created by Mirai Games
We are creating a 3rd and first person shooter with skills, variety of weapons, enemies and power ups. And lots of explosions!!

This is a fan project that we are making in our free time so don't expect much, fast progress xd.

For now we don't have much to offer but we are gonna be adding things gradually, anyone interested can see what we work on and request features or report bugs in the Issues tab of the project.

# Download: Not yet. We don't have much to show for now. 
Small and major updates will be gradually published when we start prototyping and testing for real.

# How to view/edit the code:
1. Clone the project locally.
2. Open the folder with the latest LTS version of Unity (currently 2021.3.16f1) using Unity Hub.
